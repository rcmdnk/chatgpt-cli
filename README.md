Python CLI implementation for [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt).

## Requirements

- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11

## Installation

By Homebrew:

```
$ brew install rcmdnk/rcmdnkpac/chatgpt-prompt-wrapper
```

By pip:

```
$ pip3 install chatgpt-prompt-wrapper
```

## Preparation

To get an OpenAI API key, go to [Account API Keys - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Set it as the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

To load the variable when you start the terminal, write it in **.bashrc** or **.zshrc**.

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

Alternatively, pass the key using the '-k' or '--key' argument in the command.

$ cg commands
Available subcommands:
  Reserved commands:
    ask       : Ask w/o predefined prompt.
    chat      : Start chat w/o predefined prompt.
    discuss   : Start a discussion between GPTs. Give a them as a message.

    ...
```

### Ask, Chat

`ask` and `chat` are reserved commands for running simple interaction without a predefined prompt.

- `ask`

`cg ask <message>` returns the answer from ChatGPT for `message`.

- `chat`

`cg chat` starts a chat.

:memo: In `chat` mode, all messages in the past, including answers from
ChatGPT, will be sent each time you send a new message.

The oldest message will be dropped when the total tokens (including the reserved tokens for the completion defined by `max_tokens` or `min_max_tokens`) exceeds the tokens limit (`tokens_limit` or the number of max tokens (-1) for the used model).

It means you will send almost the max length after a long conversation.
Please keep the cost in mind. You may want to set `tokens_limit`.

### Discuss

`discuss` is another reserved command which start a discussion between two ChatGPTs.

Two GPTs are ask to perform as:

- Please engage in the discussion as a supporter.
- Please engage in the discussion as a opponent.

You input message will be a message and they start a discussion.

Please push `Enter` to proceed a duscussion and `Ctrl-C` to quit a discussion.

### Configuration file

You can define your command in the configuration files.

A command can be in either `ask` mode, `chat` mode or `discuss` mode.

- `ask` mode: Send a predefined prompt and a message from the command line and receive one answer.
- `chat` mode: Start a chat with a predefined prompt if defined:
  - `chat` mode can be either `multiline` or single (`no_multiline`), and `vim` or `emacs`.
- `discuss` mode: Start a discussion between two different ChatGPTs.

#### File path

The default path to the configuration file is **$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cg/config.toml**.

If **$XDG_CONFIG_HOME** is not defined, use **~/.config/cg/config.toml**.

If it does not exist and **~/.cg/config.toml** exists,
the existing file is used.

You can change the path by `-c <file>` (`--conf <file>`) option.

#### How to write the configuration file

The configuration file is written in the [TOML format](https://toml.io/en/).

You can define a command as the top table name.

`global` is the special table to define global options,
which are enabled for all commands if the command does not have the corresponding options.

The options for each table can be:

- `description`: Description of the command.
- `mode`: Set `ask`, `chat` or `discuss`. (default is `ask` mode.)
- `show_cost`: Set `true` to show the cost at the end of the command.
- `model`: The model to use (default: "gpt-3.5-turbo").
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion. Set 0 to use the maximum values for the model. (default: 0)
- `min_max_tokens`: The minimum of `max_tokens` for the completion when `max_tokens = 0`. (default: 200)
- `tokens_limit`: The limit of the total tokens of the prompt and the completion. Set 0 to use the maximum values for the model. (default: 0)
- `temperature`: Sampling temperature (0 ~ 2). (default: 1)
- `top_p`: Probability (0 ~ 1) that the model will consider the top_p tokens. Do not set both temperature and top_p at the same time. (default: 1)
- `presence_penalty`: The penalty for the model to return the same token (-2 ~ 2). (default: 0)
- `frequency_penalty`: The penalty for the model to return the same token multiple times (-2 ~ 2). (default: 0)
- Table of `alias`: Dictionary of role aliases. The default alias is: '`user' = 'User'`, `'system' = 'System'`, `'assistant' = 'Assistant'`.
- `model_max_tokens`: Additional or updated model's max_token definitions.
- `price`: Additional or updated model's price definitions.
- List of `messages`: Dictionary of message, which must have `role` and `content` (message text).
  - For `ask`, `chat` modes, `role` must be one of `system`, `user` and `assistant`
  - For `discuss` mode, three roles, `theme`, `gpt1` and `gpt2` are needed.

The options for ask mode:

- `show`: Set `true` to show prompt for non chat command.
- `hide`: Set `true` to hide prompt for non chat command (default).

The options for chat mode:

- `multiline`: Set `true` to hide prompt for non chat command.
- `no_multiline`: Set `true` to hide prompt for non chat command (default).
- `vi`: Set `true` to use vi mode.
- `emacs`: Set `true` to use emacs mode (default).

You can make a example configuration file by `cg init`.

Here is a example configuration:

```toml
[global]
# Global configuration
# `global` is special name and not a subcommand
model = 'gpt-3.5-turbo'

# Following model_max_tokens and prices are pre-defined in
# https://github.com/rcmdnk/chatgpt-prompt-wrapper/blob/main/src/chatgpt_prompt_wrapper/chatgpt/chatgpt.py
# If you find new model or price change, you can overwrite these variables in config as below.

[global.model_max_tokens]
"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k" = 16384

[global.prices]
"gpt-3.5-turbo-16k" = [0.003, 0.004]

[test]
# Example command to test the OpenAI API, taken from below.
# [Chat completion - OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction)

description = "Example command to test the OpenAI API."
show = true

[[test.messages]]
role = "system"
content = "You are a helpful assistant."
[[test.messages]]
role = "user"
content = "Who won the world series in 2020?"
[[test.messages]]
role = "assistant"
"content" = "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."
[[test.messages]]
role = "user"
content = "Where was it played?"

[sh]
description = "Ask a shell scripting question."
[[sh.messages]]
role = "user"
content = "You are an expert of the shell scripting. Answer the following questions."

[py]
description = "Ask a python programming question."
[[py.messages]]
role = "user"
content = "You are an expert python programmer. Answer the following questions."

[enjoy_chat]
description = "Chat example with a predefined prompt."
mode = 'chat'
[[chat.messages]]
role = "user"
content = "Let's enjoy a chat."


[dd]
mode = 'discuss'

[dd.names]
gpt1 = "pros"
gpt2 = "cons"

[[dd.messages]]
role = "theme"
content = "Discuss whether or not to actively adopt ChatGPT in the education field. Please provide one-sentence responses."
[[dd.messages]]
role = "gpt1"
content = "Please speak from the standpoint that you should actively adopt ChatGPT in the field of education."
[[dd.messages]]
role = "gpt2"
content = "Please speak from the standpoint that you should not actively adopt ChatGPT in the field of education."
```

These messages will be sent as an prompt before your input message.

You can give full questions and use `cg` w/o input messages like a first example `test` command.

## Example usage as a part of an external script

### Git commit by ChatGPT

See [git-gpt-commit](https://github.com/rcmdnk/git-gpt-commit).

## Development

### Poetry

Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to setup environment.

To install poetry, run:

```
$ pip install poetry
```

or use `pipx` (`x` is `3` or anything of your python version).

Setup poetry environment:

```
$ poetry install
```

Then enter the environment:

```
$ poetry shell
```

## pre-commit

To check codes at the commit, use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/).

`pre-commit` command will be installed in the poetry environment.

First, run:

```
$ pre-commit install
```

Then `pre-commit` will be run at the commit.

Sometimes, you may want to skip the check. In that case, run:

```
$ git commit --no-verify
```

You can run `pre-commit` on entire repository manually:

```
$ pre-commit run -a
```

### pytest

Tests are written with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/).

Write tests in **/tests** directory.

To run tests, run:

```
$ pytest
```

The default setting runs tests in parallel with `-n auto`.
If you run tests in serial, run:

```
$ pytest -n 0
```

## GitHub Actions

If you push a repository to GitHub, GitHub Actions will run a test job
by [GitHub Actions](https://github.co.jp/features/actions).

The job runs at the Pull Request, too.

It checks codes with `pre-commit` and runs tests with `pytest`.
It also makes a test coverage report and uploads it to [the coverage branch](https://github.com/rcmdnk/chatgpt-prompt-wrapper/tree/coverage).

You can see the test status as a badge in the README.

### Renovate

If you want to update dependencies automatically, [install Renovate into your repository](https://docs.renovatebot.com/getting-started/installing-onboarding/).
